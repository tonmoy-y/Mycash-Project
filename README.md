<p>We know bKash is a pioneering mobile financial service in Bangladesh that
has played a significant role in transforming the country's financial landscape. Launched in
2011, bKash was established as a joint venture between BRAC Bank Limited, one of
Bangladesh's leading private banks, and Money in Motion LLC, a US-based technology
company. Our goal is to write a similar type of program that would be very close to their
functionalities. The name of our application is myCash.</p>
